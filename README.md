## Introduction
In 48 hours, I created a fullstack app to increase young student engagmement with quiz-taking. I utilized the Open Trivia API to model quizzes that could be taken by students. When users answer a question correctly, they earn in game currency to purchase various Poké balls which generate a Pokémon based on various experience level. Included is a leaderboard to compare the number of Pokémon for the top 10 users.
